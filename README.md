# Project: Creating Celestial Bodies Database on PostgreSQL
## Overview:
Earliest project on building a relational database of celestial bodies using PostgreSQL.
Project made as part of the FreeCodeCamp Relational Databases Certificate course

Main celestial bodies used:
1) Galaxies
2) Stars
3) Planets
4) Moons.

Created fictional tables within a database for each of these celestial body types, plus an additional table named 'blackhole' for fun.

Referential foreign key relationship : Galaxies > Stars > Planets > Moons.
